Stock Data Analysis

Abstract

Stock exchanges evolved to fulfil two main needs: liquidity and price discovery. The idea was that liquidity would come from investors basing decisions on reliable price data to which all participants had access. Back when trading venues were owned by their “members,” this worked — they exchanged positions among themselves and knew at what price other participants were willing to buy or sell. This provided a “fair” view of the market. Market data allows traders and investors to know the latest price and see historical trends for instruments such as equities, fixed-income products, derivatives, and currencies.


Problem Statement

In this case study, you have to visually analyse stock data for four major companies. 

Using this data, you will have to address several questions.

●	How large is the impact of open and close values on the volumes?

●	What is the trend in high and low values?

●	Display monthly peaks and valleys in volumes 

●	Apply a filter to select a company and view related data.
